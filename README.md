## Why This Project?

The term **Chinese New Year** (春節) carries thousands of years of cultural heritage rooted in the Chinese lunisolar calendar, Chinese cosmology, and Chinese astronomical tradition. Recently, corporations and institutions have been rebranding it as "Lunar New Year" — a term that is:

- **Scientifically inaccurate** (the Chinese calendar is lunisolar, not lunar)
- **Historically rooted in colonial erasure** (originating from British colonial governance in Hong Kong)
- **Culturally disrespectful** (it removes Chinese origin while still using the Chinese calendar)

This project advocates for preserving the correct name and educating people about why it matters.

## Features

- **Company Archive** — Side-by-side documentation of companies that correctly use "Chinese New Year" vs. those using the problematic "Lunar New Year"
- **Educational Article** — A well-sourced article explaining the history, science, and cultural significance behind the name, available in English and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
