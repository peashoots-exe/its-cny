          <h2>The Recent Rise of "Lunar New Year"</h2>

          <p>
            For as long as most people can remember, the world has called it <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>.
            This holiday — rooted in the Chinese Calendar, marked by the Chinese zodiac, and celebrated
            as 農曆新年 / 春節 (<em>Chūnjié</em>, "Spring Festival") across Chinese communities worldwide — has always
            carried its cultural identity in its very name.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, however, a quiet shift has taken place. Corporations, universities, and Western
            institutions have increasingly replaced "Chinese New Year" with "Lunar New Year," framing the change
            as a gesture of inclusivity. On the surface, this seems well-intentioned. But upon closer examination,
            this rebranding raises serious questions — about accuracy, about history, and about whose identity
            is actually being served.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 2 -->
          <h2>What is Chinese New Year?</h2>

          <p>
            The date of the new year that everyone celebrates is <strong>THE</strong> New Year's date on <strong>農曆, the Chinese Calendar</strong> — a sophisticated
            astronomical system developed over thousands of years in China.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a purely lunar calendar, the Chinese Calendar (農曆) is <strong>lunisolar</strong> (陰陽合曆): it harmonizes
            lunar months with <strong>solar terms</strong> (二十四節氣, the 24 <em>Jiéqì</em>) to remain aligned with
            the seasons. This dual system is what makes it possible to determine agricultural timing — hence the usage of the word "農" (literally meaning agricultural) in its name.
          </p>
          <figure class="article-figure">
            <img src="screenshots/info-24-solar-terms-v1.jpg" alt="The 24 Solar Terms (二十四節氣) of the Chinese Calendar" loading="lazy">
            <figcaption>Infographic created based on <strong>杨扬杨</strong>'s note on Red Note</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The calendar's deeper structure includes the <strong>60-year cycle of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches</strong>
            (天干地支) and the <strong>12-year zodiac cycle</strong> (十二生肖 [Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig]) — both products of Chinese cosmological
            tradition that have no equivalent in other calendrical systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Chinese New Year</strong> (<strong>春節 / 農曆新年</strong>) is the name of this date on the Chinese Calendar, and it's the most significant traditional festival in Chinese culture.
          </p>

          <h3>How is the Date Determined?</h3>
          <p>
            This new year's date is uniquely Chinese because of three things: its calculation, its meridian line, and the day that starts the new year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The calendar and the computation that drives it are Chinese in origin and practice. In modern times, the date of the new year on the Chinese Calendar is calculated by the <strong>Purple Mountain Observatory</strong>
            (紫金山天文台) in Nanjing, China, based on the <strong>Meridian Line</strong> that passes through the center of the observation instruments at Purple Mountain (紫金山), under <strong>China Standard Time (UTC+8)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A new moon — the astronomical event that marks the start of a lunar month — occurs at a single precise
            instant in universal time. However, when that instant is converted to local time, it can fall on
            different calendar dates depending on the time zone. For example, if a new moon occurs at 23:30 UTC, it
            is already the next day in China (UTC+8), while it is still the previous day in countries at UTC+7.
          </p>
          <p>
            If each country defined the New Year based on its own local time zone, it could fall on
            different days in different countries. This is precisely why the world has been using <strong>Chinese New Year as the ONE and ONLY golden standard </strong>for this date, and Asian countries celebrate this holiday based on the Chinese New Year, the Chinese Calendar and its system.
          </p>

          <h3>Relationship to Other Asian Holidays</h3>
          <p>
            Many countries across Southeast Asia explicitly refer to this holiday as <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>.
            In <strong>Thailand</strong> (ตรุษจีน, "Chinese New Year"), <strong>Malaysia</strong>,
            <strong>Singapore</strong>, <strong>the Philippines</strong>, and <strong>Indonesia</strong>,
            the holiday is widely and officially called Chinese New Year — reflecting both its cultural origin and
            the significant Chinese diaspora communities in those nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, some East Asian cultures modeled their traditions after the Chinese New Year (the calendar, zodiac, etc.) and celebrate their own New Year at the same time, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tết Nguyên Đán</strong> — Vietnamese</li>
            <li><strong>Seollal</strong> (설날) — Korean</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            They have been immensely influenced by the Chinese Calendar and the Chinese culture, co-evolved over
            centuries, and added some of their own customs, foods, rituals, and meanings. This is exactly how cultural exchange works — and it deserves to be acknowledged with
            specificity, not flattened under a single vague label.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the Chinese origin of the calendar does not diminish the Korean-ness of Seollal or the
            Vietnamese-ness of Tết. It simply maintains clarity about where the underlying system came from.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 3 -->
          <h2>Why "Lunar New Year" is Problematic</h2>

          <h3>1. It's Scientifically Inaccurate</h3>
          <p>
            The Chinese Calendar is not lunar. It incorporates both lunar phases and solar
            terms. Calling it "Lunar New Year" is a misnomer that misrepresents the very system it claims to describe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Islamic Hijri calendar</strong> is a truly lunar calendar — it does not synchronize with the
            solar year and drifts roughly 11 days each year relative to the Gregorian calendar. For instance, in 2026, the Islamic New Year
            (1 Muharram) falls around <strong>June</strong>. <em>That</em> would be an actual "Lunar New Year."
            The Chinese New Year in that same year falls in <strong>February</strong> — precisely because of its
            solar component.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the same term for two fundamentally different calendrical systems is not just imprecise — it's misleading.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Its Origins Are Colonial, Not Organic</h3>
          <figure class="article-figure">
            <img src="screenshots/lny-colonial-hongkong-root.JPG" alt="Colonial Hong Kong origin of the term Lunar New Year" loading="lazy">
          </figure>
          <p>
            The term "Lunar New Year" did not emerge from Asian communities themselves. It was institutionalized
            in English through <strong>British colonial governance in Hong Kong</strong> in 1968 — a context in which the
            deliberate purpose was to de-center Chinese cultural ownership and flatten local identity under
            colonial administration. [Source: Holidays (Amendment) Bill 1968 — Bill No. 11 of 1968, published in Legal Supplement No. 3 to the Hong Kong Government Gazette on 11 April 1968.
            PDF via Hong Kong e‑Legislation: <a href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/1968/04/11/supp3/1!en" target="_blank">elegislation.gov.hk</a>]
          </p>
          <p>
            When a term is created from above specifically to neutralize a culture's claim to its own traditions,
            its origin is not incidental — it is the entire point. Language does not cleanse itself simply because
            time passes. We do not accept other terms of colonial or dehumanizing origin merely because
            "people don't mean it that way anymore."
          </p>
          <p>
            Using "Lunar New Year" doesn't decolonize the holiday — it removes its Chinese origin while still
            relying on the Chinese calendar. This is not progress. It is the perpetuation of colonial logic
            with contemporary packaging.
          </p>

          <h3>3. It Replaces Real Inclusion with Cultural Erasure</h3>
          <p>
            Consider these parallels: <strong>English</strong> remains "English," despite being a global language. We still say <strong>Christmas</strong>, even though it is celebrated around the
            world. <strong>K-pop</strong> retains its Korean identity despite its international audience. <strong>African dance traditions</strong> are
            not renamed generically when they cross borders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet when it comes to Chinese New Year, we are told that "inclusivity" requires removing its cultural
            origin from its name — while continuing to use its zodiac, its calendar, and its date.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not inclusion. It is the selective erasure of one culture's identity under the guise of universality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collapsing distinct holidays into a single origin-free label does not honor diversity — it flattens it.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>"Inclusion that depends on erasing origin isn't inclusion — it's cultural appropriation with polite language."</strong></p>
          </blockquote>

          <!-- Section 4 -->
          <h2>What Should We Call It?</h2>

          <p>The answer is simple: <strong>call each culture's holiday by its own name.</strong></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>🎊 Happy <strong>Chinese New Year</strong> (or Chunjie / 春節)!</p>
            <p>🎊 Happy <strong>Tết</strong> (Vietnamese)!</p>
            <p>🎊 Happy <strong>Seollal</strong> (Korean)!</p>            
            <p>🎊 …and happy New Year to all cultures celebrating around this season!</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This approach acknowledges the shared historical roots in the Chinese Calendar <em>and</em>
            honors the distinct cultural evolution of each tradition. It is both historically accurate and genuinely
            inclusive.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an umbrella term must be used, <strong>"Chinese New Year"</strong> or <strong>"Spring Festival"</strong>
            is far more accurate than "Lunar New Year." The holiday is THE new year's date on the Chinese Calendar. It is lunisolar, not lunar. 
            Its date, structure, and system originate from Chinese astronomy. The name should reflect that reality.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 5 -->
          <h2>World Leaders &amp; Public Figures Celebrate Chinese New Year</h2>
          <p>
            Around the world, heads of state, public figures, and celebrities already use the correct name.
            Here are just a few examples:
          </p>

          <div class="figure-gallery">
            <figure class="article-figure">

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            Even <strong>Tom Felton</strong> — the actor best known as Draco Malfoy in <em>Harry Potter</em> — made the switch.
            His Chinese name 馬爾福 (<em>Mǎ'ěrfú</em>) contains the characters for horse (馬) and fortune (福),
            making him a cultural icon for the upcoming Year of the Horse. After initially posting "Happy Luna New Year,"
            he corrected himself to <strong>"Happy Chinese New Year"</strong>.

            <h3>A Message to the Chinese Diaspora Worldwide</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Speak up — confidently and respectfully.</strong> Recognizing the Chinese origin of this holiday
              is not exclusionary. It is historically accurate, scientifically correct, and culturally respectful.
              Do not let anyone tell you that honoring your heritage is an act of exclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              True inclusion means acknowledging every culture's contributions with specificity and care — not

          <h2>「Lunar New Year」的興起</h2>

          <p>
            在大多數人的記憶中，全世界一直稱之為<strong>「Chinese New Year」</strong>。這個植根於中國農曆、
            以中國生肖為標誌、被全球華人社區稱為<strong>農曆新年</strong>的節日，其名稱本身便承載著它的文化身份。
          </p>
          <p>
            然而近两年來，一場悄無聲息的轉變正在發生。企業、大學和西方機構越來越多地將「Chinese New Year」替換為
            「Lunar New Year」，將這一更改包裝為包容性的姿態。表面上看，這似乎出於好意。但仔細審視後，這一重新命名引發了嚴肅的問題 ── 關於準確性、關於歷史、關於究竟是誰的身份認同在被服務。
          </p>

          <h2>什麼是農曆新年？</h2>

          <p>
            眾人所慶祝的新年日期，正是<strong>農曆——中國曆法</strong>上的新年之日。這是一套在中國歷經數千年發展而成的精密天文曆法系統。
          </p>
          <p>
            與純粹的陰曆不同，中國農曆是<strong>陰陽合曆</strong>：它將太陰月與<strong>二十四節氣</strong>相結合，
            使曆法與季節保持一致。正是這一雙重系統使得確定農時成為可能——因此它被稱為<strong>「農」曆</strong>（「農」即農業之意）。
          </p>
          <figure class="article-figure">
            <img src="screenshots/info-24-solar-terms-v1.jpg" alt="二十四節氣圖解" loading="lazy">
            <figcaption>圖表根據<strong>杨扬杨</strong>的小紅書筆記製作</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            曆法更深層的結構包括<strong>六十年一循環的天干地支</strong>和<strong>十二年一循環的生肖</strong>（十二生肖：鼠、牛、虎、兔、龍、蛇、馬、羊、猴、雞、狗、豬），二者皆是中國宇宙觀傳統的獨特產物，在其他曆法系統中沒有對應。
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>（<strong>春節 / 農曆新年</strong>）正是中國農曆上這一日期的名稱，也是中華文化中最重要的傳統節日。
          </p>

          <h3>日期如何確定？</h3>
          <p>
            這個新年日期之所以獨屬於中國，源於三個要素：其計算方法、其子午線、以及開啟新年的那一天。
          </p>
          <p>
            這套曆法及驅動它的計算方法，在起源和實踐上都是中國的。在現代，農曆新年的日期由位於中國南京的<strong>紫金山天文台</strong>計算，
            以穿過紫金山觀測儀器中心的<strong>子午線</strong>為基準，採用<strong>中國標準時間（UTC+8）</strong>。
          </p>
          <p>
            新月——標誌著一個太陰月開始的天文事件——在世界協調時間中發生於一個精確的瞬間。然而，當這一瞬間被轉換為當地時間時，
            在不同時區可能對應不同的日曆日期。例如，若新月發生在 UTC 23:30，在中國（UTC+8）已是次日，
            而在 UTC+7 的國家仍是前一天。
          </p>
          <p>
            如果各國根據自己的當地時區來確定新年日期，它便可能在不同國家落在不同的日子。這正是全世界一直將<strong>Chinese New Year 作為這一日期唯一的黃金標準</strong>的原因，而亞洲各國也正是基於Chinese New Year、中國農曆及其體系來慶祝這個節日。
          </p>

          <h3>與其他亞洲節日的關係</h3>
          <p>
            在<strong>泰國</strong>（ตรุษจีน，即「中國新年」）、<strong>馬來西亞</strong>、<strong>新加坡</strong>、
            <strong>菲律賓</strong>和<strong>印尼</strong>，這個節日被廣泛且正式地稱為Chinese New Year。
          </p>
          <p>另外，也有一些東亞文化以農曆新年為範本（如中國曆法、生肖等），並在同一時間慶祝各自的新年，例如：</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tết Nguyên Đán</strong> ── 越南</li>
            <li><strong>설날</strong>（Seollal）── 韓國</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            它們深受中國農曆和中華文化的影響，在數百年間共同演變，並加入了一些各自的習俗、飲食、儀式和意義。這正是文化交流的運作方式 ── 它值得被具體地承認，而非被壓縮在一個模糊的單一標籤之下。
          </p>
          <p>
            承認曆法的中國起源並不會削弱설날的韓國特質或Tết的越南特質。它只是清楚地說明了這套底層系統的來源。
          </p>

          <h2>為什麼「Lunar New Year」有問題</h2>

          <h3>一、在科學上不準確</h3>
          <p>
            農曆是<strong>陰陽合曆</strong>，而非純陰曆。它同時包含太陰月相和太陽節氣。稱之為「Lunar New Year」
            是一種錯誤稱謂，歪曲了它所聲稱描述的系統本身。
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>伊斯蘭希吉里曆</strong>才是真正的純陰曆。它不與太陽年同步，每年相對於公曆漂移約11天。
            在2026年，伊斯蘭新年（Muharram 1日）大約在<strong>6月</strong>。<em>那</em>才是真正的
            「Lunar New Year」（陰曆新年）。而同年的農曆新年在<strong>2月</strong> ── 這正是因為其太陽曆成分。
          </p>
          <p>
            對兩個根本不同的曆法系統使用同一名稱，不僅是不精確的──更是誤導性的。
          </p>

          <h3>二、其起源是殖民性的，而非自發性的</h3>
          <figure class="article-figure">

          </figure>
          <p>
            「Lunar New Year」一詞並非從亞洲社區中自然產生。它是在1968年通過<strong>英國在香港的殖民統治</strong>被制度化引入英語的 ──
            在那個語境下，其刻意目的是削弱中國的文化主體性，將本地身份認同壓平在殖民管治之下。[Source: Holidays (Amendment) Bill 1968 — Bill No. 11 of 1968, published in Legal Supplement No. 3 to the Hong Kong Government Gazette on 11 April 1968.
            PDF via Hong Kong e‑Legislation: <a href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/1968/04/11/supp3/1!en" target="_blank">elegislation.gov.hk</a>]
          </p>
          <p>
            當一個詞語是從上而下被刻意創造出來、專門用以消解一種文化對其自身傳統的主張時，它的起源就並非偶然，而是其全部要義所在。語言不會僅僅因為時間流逝就自動淨化。我們不會因為「人們現在不是那個意思了」
            就接受其他具有殖民或非人化起源的詞語。
          </p>
          <p>
            使用「Lunar New Year」並非在為這個節日去殖民化 ── 它移除了中國的文化起源，卻仍然依賴中國的曆法和傳統。
            這不是進步，而是以當代包裝延續殖民邏輯。
          </p>

          <h3>三、以包容之名行文化抹殺之實</h3>
          <p>
            請考慮這些對比：
            <strong>英語</strong>依然叫 English，儘管它是一門全球語言。
            我們依然稱<strong>聖誕節</strong>為 Christmas，儘管全世界都在慶祝。            
            <strong>K-pop</strong> 保留了其韓國身份，儘管其聽眾遍布國際。
            <strong>非洲舞蹈傳統</strong>跨越國界時也不會被籠統地改名。
          </p>
          <p>
            然而說到「Chinese New Year」，人們卻告訴我們，「包容性」要求從其名稱中移除文化起源 ── 同時繼續使用它的生肖、
            它的曆法和它的日期。
          </p>
          <p>
            這不是包容。這是假借普遍性的名義，有選擇性地抹殺一種文化的身份。
          </p>
          <p>
            將各不相同的節日壓縮為一個不標明起源的單一標籤，並不是在尊重多元，而是在抹平多元。
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>「依靠抹去起源來實現的包容不是包容 ── 而是披著禮貌外衣的文化挪用。」</strong></p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>我們應該怎麼稱呼它？</h2>

          <p>答案很簡單：<strong>以每種文化各自的名稱稱呼其節日。</strong></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>🎊 <strong>春節快樂</strong>（或者農曆新年快樂）！</p>
            <p>🎊 <strong>Tết快樂</strong>（越南）！</p>
            <p>🎊 <strong>설날快樂</strong>（韓國）！</p>            
            <p>🎊 ……以及向所有在這個季節慶祝新年的文化致以新年祝福！</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            這一做法既承認了各節日在中國農曆中的共同歷史根源，<em>又</em>尊重了每個傳統各自獨立的文化演變。
            它既是歷史上準確的，也是真正具有包容性的。
          </p>
          <p>
            如果必須使用統稱，<strong>「Chinese New Year」</strong>或<strong>「Spring Festival」（春節）</strong>
            遠比「Lunar New Year」更為準確。這個節日基於陰陽合曆，而非純陰曆。其日期、結構和體系均源自中國天文學。
            名稱應當反映這一事實。
          </p>

          <p>
            世界各地的國家元首、公眾人物和名人早已使用正確的名稱。以下是一些例子：
          </p>

          <p>
            就連<strong>Tom Felton</strong> —— 以《哈利波特》系列中 Draco Malfoy 一角聞名的演員 —— 也做出了改變。
            他的中文譯名「馬爾福」包含了「馬」（horse）和「福」（fortune）兩字，使他在即將到來的馬年格外受歡迎，
            電商平台上甚至出現了印有他肖像的新年裝飾品。
            他最初發帖寫的是「Happy Luna New Year」，之後改為了正確的<strong>「Happy Chinese New Year」</strong>。

            <p>
              <strong>請自信而有尊嚴地發聲。</strong>承認這個節日的中國起源並不意味著排他。它在歷史上是準確的，
              在科學上是正確的，在文化上是尊重的。不要被當下的舆论裹挟。珍視自己的文化傳承是理所當然的，值得驕傲的！
            </p>
            <p>
              真正的包容意味著以具體和審慎的態度承認每種文化的貢獻 ── 而非為了那些不了解其中差異之人的舒適感，
              就將它們在一個籠統的標籤之下全部抹去。
